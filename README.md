# Weather Forecast App

This is a companion app that I have used in my LogRocket post [How to use Claude to build a web app](https://blog.logrocket.com/claude-web-app/). The post and this project cover building web applications with [Claude](https://claude.ai/). I built this application with Claude and you can see the progressive changes done through the Git commits.

The project is a React application that uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to provide a weather forecast for select cities.

The project consists of one page with a dropdown that allows you to select specific cities to display a weather forecast.

The project was built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) and also use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/) for formatting.
